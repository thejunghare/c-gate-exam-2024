// this is the boiler plate of C

#include <stdio.h> // with out this header file compiler will don't know what is printf

// main function
int main(void) {
  // void -> return type of main function
  printf("Hello World!\n");
  //  f in the printf stands for formatted, it acts as an placeholder and substitute for variable (more on this in next folders) it let the compiler know what type the variable is when value of output is unkown

  // \n is an espace character used to print a new line
